        Front-end web developer and student. When I'm not building web apps,
        you'll probably find me deep in a chess game, hitting the gym or
        enjoying good food. <br /> Currently focused on front-end Development,
        but I'm on a journey toward becoming a full-stack developer with strong
        backend skills too.
